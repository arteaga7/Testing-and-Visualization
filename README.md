## Overview
This project is used to both perform testing and display some graphics to inform about the testing results. There are two pages:

-In page "Testing", it is possible to select the xlsx file to perform testing or to use a default FTS file by checking the checkbox "Use default FTS file (for mobile application)" (fig. 1). By clicking on "Perform testing" (fig. 2), a report is generated automatically including a pie plot (fig. 3). It is possible to make changes in the report and the pie plot will be updated automatically.

-In page "Metrics", all information about testing progress is obtained by setting two filters, by date and by feature (fig. 4). It is not possible to make changes in the results. A bar plot is used to show the total performed TestCases and every bar corresponds to every feature tested (fig. 5).
